🔧 What I built using Power BI ❓ 
⭐ Performed data modeling by creating dimension tables from the fact table to achieve a clean star schema and improve report performance.

I designed an interactive dashboard featuring:
 ✔ DAX-based Calculated Columns & Measures
 1. Delivery Criteria (Fast / Good /Average / Late / Worst)
 2. On-Time Delivery Percentage
 3. Delay Days Calculation (Estimated days - Actual delivery days)
 4. Payment Status Measures (Success, Failed, Pending)
 5. Cost per KG per KM
 6. KPI- (Estimated delivery & on time delivery by delivery hub)

✔ Visualizations Used:
 1. Gauge Chart (Actual & Estimated delivery days)
 2. Map Visual (Receiver Location & Delivery Hub)
 3. KPI Cards (Total Shipment, Total_Shipment_Cost, Total_Weight, Unique Customers)
 4. Slicers (Courier, Location, Shipment_Status, Payment_Status)
 5. Bar, Line, Donut, Area, Funnel& Pie Charts
 6. Scatter Plot for Shipment_cost, Shipment_weight by Shipment_status and Delay days.
 7. Table chart for detailed shipment & courier insights and used cell elements like data bars, icons, font color and background color.
 8. Buttons and a Summary Sticker Section for navigation.

🚚 Key Insights Identified
📍 Location-wise On-Time Delivery %
 📍 Courier-wise delayed & On Time deliveries
 📍 Shipment cost behavior by weight & distance
 📍 Payment failures, success, Pending trends
 📍 Customer rating & delivery time

🎓 Training Completed
I’m happy to share that I successfully completed the Power BI course at Besant Technologies Anna Nagar,Besant Technologies, guided by a very supportive trainer "Deva" who helped me understand DAX, visuals, and dashboard storytelling.
This project strengthened my confidence in real-time data analysis and business reporting. Looking forward to applying these skills in analytics-driven roles! 🚀
